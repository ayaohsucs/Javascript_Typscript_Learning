# Javascript Engine
- a kind of process virtual machine that is designed speicifically to interpret and execute JavaScript code
- process virtual machine: for example, `Wine` allows you to run windows application on a Linux machine
- system virtual machine: for example, `Parallels` allows you to run Windows on Mac
- Layout Engines: power a broser by laying out web pages
- task: takes the source code, breaks it into strings, converts the string into bytecode, and executes it
- Googleâ€™s V8 engine, written in C++, also compiles and executes JavaScript source code, handles memory allocation, and garbage collects leftovers
