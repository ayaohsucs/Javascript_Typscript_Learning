# HTML & CSS
- HTML will always represent content
- CSS will always represent the appearance of that content
- HTML: elements, tags, attributes
- Element: defines the structure and content of the object. Ex, anchor element:
```
a
```
- Tag: enclosing an element with `<` `>`. Opening tag and closing tag:
```
<a>
</a>
```
- Attribute: properties used to provide additional information about an element. Ex, `href` attribute would look like
```
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg LP</a></p>
```

- self closing element: element that requires only one single tag
```
<meta type="text/javascript" src="mycode.js" />
```

# Getting to know HTML
- Semantics: Semantic code describes the value of content on a page, regardless of the style of that content
- div: division, to identify large groupings of content; block-level element
- span: to identify smaller groupings of text; inline-level element
- Inline-level elements should not wrap block-level elements
- *Semantic code*: no literal meaning vs *structurally based elements*: provide meaning to the block
- Structurally based elements: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.
